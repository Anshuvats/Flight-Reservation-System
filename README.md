# Flight-Reservation-System

- ### About:-
        This is a simple project as a part of college course made entirely in Java and Swing. 
        Users can search for one-way flights between three north-western cities and Singapore.
        There are  two .csv files are used as database to read flights, and another to write booking details.
        It was a two member team project. I did all the back-end work and also some of the front end work.
